  <div class="box round"><h3>About Melissa:</h3></div>   
  <p>I am a Bay Area Native and I grew up during the MySpace era, which was when most of us had no idea we were learning some HTML and CSS basics with custom fonts, graphics, and profiles. When MySpace was more popular, having fun with editing my profile initially sparked my interest in web development and software development.</p>

  <p>Previously, I also went to school for Anthropology, Paralegal Studies, and Real Estate. I am a licensed REALTOR® and commissioned Notary, and previously worked as a Paralegal. With my background, I have also gained many skills that are transferable to software development including providing a high level of attention to detail, ability to work collaboratively, handle confidential information with the utmost care, organize data, and effectively communicate.</p>

  <p>With the experience I have gained in my previous and current roles, I am very excited to become a student at Thinkful and continue my journey as a software developer.</p>

  <p>My interests outside of my passion for software development include:</p>
